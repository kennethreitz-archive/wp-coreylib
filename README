So, Aaron Collegeman (http://aaroncollegeman.com) wrote Coreylib (http://coreylib.com). Kenneth Reitz  (http://kennethreitz.com) added this library to a folder, and called it a plugin.
This is that plugin.  

Installation Instructions:

   1) Copy this folder into : WP_HOME/plugins/
   2) Wordpress Admin > Plugins > coreylib > activate

You can now call clAPI from anywhere in your theme :)
