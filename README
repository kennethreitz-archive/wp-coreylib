This is Coreylib for Wordpress.

Kenneth Reitz (http://kennethreitz.com) added the file to a folder, and called it a plugin.
	And life was good. 


** Installation Instructions **

   1) copy this folder into : WP_HOME/plugins/
   2) Wordpress Admin > Plugins > coreylib > activate

You can now call clAPI from anywhere in your theme :)
